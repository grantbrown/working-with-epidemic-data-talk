              Based on these assumptions and their associated parameters, we can derive a parametric form for the exposure probability at a particular time point
              and spatial location, which is required to construct the HM. The result is a flexible parameterization that can accommodate
              numerous population structures.</p>

                  though it is generally presented differently for each problem. We have developed a general structure to tackle a wide
                  variety of hypotheses, as well as to provide appropriate temporal bases for prediction in the absence of full information
