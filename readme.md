Working With Epidemic Data
=============================

A web based talk and non-technical overview of my recent research, created for a seminar at [Cornell College](http://www.cornellcollege.edu/).


Created in a slideshow style using the Boostrap HTML/Javascript/CSS framework and based on the "Cover" template, this talk (ab)uses the carousel functionality with the addition of some custom javascript to create a slideshow with text, images, and interactive elements. For best results, view in full screen and use your browsers zoom functionality to eliminate scrolling.
